<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 1.27cm">The installation process
involves four initial stages for building the base system. We firstly
need to partition and format and media that we intend to install the
operating system on. Generally this is done on a Hard drive of
varying description however is limited to being at least <FONT COLOR="#008000">&lt;Distro
size&gt;</FONT>GB and we recommend having <FONT COLOR="#008000">&lt;Recommend
Size&gt;</FONT>GB for installing other applications not currently
supported by our distro. Once the hard drive is partitioned and the
file system has been formatted we can move onto unpacking the base
system. This is done by mounting the media and transfer files to it.
The system then needs to have users and password defined so as to
secure it from unintended usage. Finally we will be amending some
simple settings to ensure that when the system reboots network
interfaces, file systems and applications will function correctly.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 1.27cm">Partitioning is breaking
the hard drive into logical parts to store relevant information for
the system. Historically this was done for many reasons but has
origins in older tape systems and distributed network systems. It is
a great tool for being able to manage redundacy and temporary data.
For most home workstation systems the partition is very simple. We
generally need only create three partitions: A small boot partition
and the start of the hard drive, next we&rsquo;ll have some temporary
data storage and lastly the remainder of the system. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 1.27cm">Breaking the data into
three (or more) logical partitions has many advantages (and
disadvantages) so I&rsquo;ll only cover them briefly. Having a small
boot partition at the start of the drive is the obvious place to have
bootable files. You could really store them anywhere however the
position of the <B>small </B>partition will make sense shortly. We
keep only the files necessary to boot into the system in this space.
As they are not needed once the system is up, the partition can then
be unmounted. Common files to find here are the Kernel image itself
as well as system maps and boot configuration files. We recommend
having at least 10MB (Space to keep at least one kernel and one
backup) and not needing any more than 50MB.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 1.27cm">The temporary data
storage is called swap space. The swap space is similar to a Windows
or Mac OS virtual memory file. The advantages of having a fixed
partition for this information at the top of a hard drive is that you
ensure speed of access. The obvious drawback however is that it is of
a fixed maximum size (This can also been seen as an advantage
considering some algorithms for handling virtual memory allocation
and release). Swap space can be a difficult one to allocate, the
general rule of thumb &ndash; three times your physical memory may no
longer apply. There is literature online if you want a more informed
choice however you can apply the formula <FONT COLOR="#008000">&lt;Insert
Formula here&gt;</FONT>.

<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.27cm"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Now that we have
partitions created we need to format the filesystem so as we can
write to it. Linux can natively read and write to many different
filesystem types. Most commonly found is the <A HREF="http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/ext2.html">second
extended filesystem</A> which is a robust filesystem designed to
recoverable and extensible. Like any good movie series though there
is a third iteration, but unlike the movies et3fs is an improvement
on the last by adding journaling support for the volume. <BR><A HREF="http://www.namesys.com/content_table.html">ReiserFS</A>
is a common alternative to the mainstream filesystems. It is a
journaling filesystem which has been designed with small files in
mind, but that's not to say that it doesn't handle large files well.
As the homepage suggests comparitive tests show ReiserFS to be more
efficient than its ext3fs counterpart. <BR>To further understand the
complexities of filesystems my first stop would be the <A HREF="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Filesystems-HOWTO.html">HOWTO</A>
guide on <A HREF="http://tldp.org/">The Linux Documentation Project</A>.
In summary, we recommend formating with ext3fs as it's vanilla yet
has the support for journaling which improves stability.</SPAN></P>

		</P>
		<P>Linux is a multiuser system. Not only does this mean that more
		than one person can store their personal preferences, background
		images or desktop layouts seprately without effecting other users
		it means that more than one user can be logged in at the same time.
		Before we divert off topic into how this is possible lets focus on
		creating the names and passwords of the users that will need access
		to the system. 
		</P>
		<P>User names are just a string of up to 8 characters which is also
		case sensitive.  Then type a password for the user, as with any
		password it is advisable to have a combination of letters, upper
		and lowercase, numbers and symbols. Passwords should be more than 8
		characters in length and not something easily guessed eg.
		&ldquo;Password1&rdquo; and &ldquo;Secrets1&rdquo; are bad.
		&ldquo;3l3phAnts&rdquo;, &ldquo;F1reTruck5&rdquo; and &ldquo;3L1teH4x0r5&rdquo;
		are better. 
		</P>
		<LI><P><SPAN LANG="en-US"><FONT COLOR="#ff6600">Set the root passwd</FONT></SPAN>
				</P>
		<P>&ldquo;What if I forget my password?&rdquo; No problem. A unix
		system has taken this into account by adding the super user. For
		all practical purposes the super user (Normally known as root) is
		God to the system. Root has no restrictions and therefore can be
		very Jeckel and Hyde. While root has the power to restore the
		system from any problem, root also can botch it beyond repair. If
		someone wants to break into your system they normally go for the
		superuser for obvious reasons. This is why it is imperative to
		select a password for the superuser that only you will know and be
		sure to remember it!</P>

		</P>
		<P>Having a home directory for each user on the system just makes
		sense! Keeping Mum's solitaire high scores seperated from Dad's
		memoires and your own files keeps thing organised and straigh
		forward. Important administration tasks are greatly improved for
		one, eg. Backing up all the created files in the system should be
		as easy as tarball, gzipping the /home directory and burning a CD.
		It also means that no one else can view work that they shouldn't
		have access to. I.e. No more prying eyes reading diary entries,
		veiwing you personal collection of photo's or deleting the save
		game of civ that took threee days to finally amass enough power to
		wipe out the America's!</P>
		<P>This also means that working collaboratively would be a
		nightmare, hence the need for groups. Group permissions enable the
		system to share access rights between several users. Continuing on
		the example above Mum and Dad would presumable belong to the group
		Parents. Parents would need to be able to access things like
		budget.file and /home/bills where as Children would not. This is
		quite an over simplification for the implemetations of users and
		groups however hopefully this gives you the idea.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 3.81cm">To help you get started
with users and groups we have defined user and poweruser for you
convenience. To discriminate the two groups essentially users will be
able to log on and use the system (including things like audio and CD
writers if applicable) and log off when done. Powerusers by contrast
will be able to change runlevels (including rebooting and shutdown),
install new software, and generally configure the system. This power
does come at a price as it also includes the ability to change
important system settings. If you're unsure about which group to add,
add user. It can always be changed later and remember any
configuration of the system can be done by temporary use of the
superuser.</P>
