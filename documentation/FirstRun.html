<H1>First Run Guide</H1>
<OL>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Just before you exit this guide let me take
	two minutes and explain it's purpose. For those of you new to Linux
	or migrating from other Linux distributions it might be worth while
	poking around to find out what we do differently for Atomic Linux to
	stand out as a unique distribution. Our latest revision will include
	many tools that you may already be familiar with however I'm sure
	that being an Atomican you'll not only want to know the OS inside
	and out but you'll also feel the urge to tweak it, change it or just
	blow it all away!</FONT></P>
	<H2>Migrating from windows</H2>
	<OL TYPE=a>
		<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">If you're migrating from the ever present
		Windows flavour of operating systems do not despair at the lack of
		GUI with which you are presented for all will soon become clear.
		Linux has a GUI! Most commonly found is <A HREF="http://www.XFree86.org/" NAME="Xfree86">XFree86</A></FONT>
		and is included in Atomix. Linux does not restrict you to
		applications that will only run in a GUI. This is an important
		difference in paradigm to Windows offerings. Essentially though
		Linux won't leave you stranded for applications and tools if you
		choose not to use a GUI.</P>

	<H2>Fundamentals of the console</H2>
	<OL TYPE=a>
		<P>For those of you wondering, the 'ALT' stands for alternate and
		'CTRL' also means control and I'm still yet to find an Anykey!
		Anywho the 'local' service is running 4 terminals on your Linux
		system right now! &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; I hear you ask. The
		answer to that lies in the mystery that is the Linux kernel.
		Essentially because Linux is a multiuser system, more that one user
		can be logged in at any one time. This can be done in a variety of
		ways but the two most common are at the console and over TCP/IP. 
		</P>
		<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">For those of you who are rather attached
		to a mouse this may be a new experience for you. Anyone who has
		ever had experience with any of the DOS flavours will relish in
		this new environment. Getting around in the shell (Bash) is easy.
		Type <B>ls</B> to get a current listing of the current directory.
		Typing <B>cd</B> will <B>C</B>hange <B>D</B>irectory but wait a
		minute don't go quiting this program just yet for I'm about to
		demonstrate one of the most powerful features of Linux, </FONT>The
		alternate console!</P>
		<P>By using a combination of the 'ALT' key and the function keys
		1-4 you can cycle through the first four console logins. Pressing
		'ALT' + 'F1' will return you here. On each of these new consoles
		you will be presented with another login. For now login on an
		alternate console, then you can return here so that you can
		continue to read this document and play with your system. Stop
		sniggering I said system! Read on and learn how to navigate your
		home directory and create, modify and delete stuff!</P>
		<P>As mentioned <B>ls</B> <B>l</B>i<B>s</B>ts a the current
		directory and <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><B>cd </B>will
		<B>c</B>hange the <B>d</B>irectory and these are fundamental
		commands for navigating the filesystem. Let's now have a quick play
		with organising the filesystem. Firstly navigate to your home
		directory by typing <B>cd ~ </B><I>(tilde &ndash; This should
		appear on the key next to 1). </I>Typing <B>mkdir stuff</B> will
		<B>m</B>a<B>k</B>e a <B>dir</B>ectory named <B>stuff</B>. Change to
		the directory stuff and we'll create a file called hello_world by
		typing <B>echo Hi this is my Atomic Linux box &gt; hello_world</B>.
		This line <B>echo</B>'s the string '<B>Hi this is my Atomic Linux
		box</B>' into <B>hello_world</B> using <B>&gt; </B><I>(An output
		redirection)</I>. </SPAN>
		</P>
	</OL>
	<H2>TAB key</H2>
	<OL TYPE=a>
		<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Cool, so so far we can switch consoles,
		navigate directories, and create simple text files. We shall now
		learn about the wonderkey. Auto-completion is a wonderful thing.
		Blessed be the programmer that decided they were too lazy to type
		the full filesystem path all the time. Repeat after me, Hail to the
		TAB key, the TAB key the TAB key. Hail to the TAB key, TAB key, the
		Man!</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Suffice to say that I'm suitably impressed
		by it's function in the console and as I'll demonstrate you'll know
		doubt be amazed also. We firstly want to make things difficult for
		ourselves so change directories a few times until you feel
		comfortably lost! Once you're happy that you are nowhere near your
		home directory, I want you to display the contents of the file
		hello_world on the console. Those that rushed ahead and are now
		reading this after they typed out the full path of the file will
		kick themselves when the learn the quicker way. If we type <B>cat
		/h [TAB] </B>you'll find that console has completed the directory
		/home for you. If the path doesn't complete then there are more
		than one options to choose from and you have to narrow the search.
		Hit the TAB key twice to find the output for current options on
		completing the path. (Note that if you only have one option the
		console will complete it). Once you located hello_world hit enter
		(You command line should look something like<B> cat
		/home/sexgod/hello_world</B>) and it should output <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><I>Hi
		this is my Atomic Linux box</I>.</SPAN></FONT></P>

	<H2>Locate</H2>
	<OL TYPE=a>
		<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Being able to display files is pretty
		handy but I'd say being able to find them would be better. Now most
		GUI's will be able to handle this quite sexily with an icon or
		three but where does that leave us on the command line? You could
		achieve this with a script using ls and grep but binaries are
		faster in runtime (A disadvantage is that binaries need to be
		recompiled every time you change them). </FONT>
		</P>
		<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The application for achieving this feat is
		<B>locate</B>. Go and try it now! Type <B>locate hello_world </B>and
		it should return <I>/home/someone/hello_world </I>or similar. Try a
		few others like gcc, glibc and linux. To get more information about
		any application try asking it for help. I.e. <B>Locate --help</B></FONT></P>

	<H2>Where to go....</H2>
	<OL TYPE=a>
		<P>If you've read this far let me take another 10 minutes of your
		time to explain where to find help, where all your devices are and
		now that you have a Linux system that you can brag about what you
		should do next! 
		</P>
		<H2>Help!</H2>

		<H2>Who's the Man?</H2>
		<OL TYPE=i>
			<P>No, it's not a bird, or a plane and you can count yourself
			lucky it isn't a paperclip either! It's a command and a might
			powerful one at that. Typing <B>man </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">(The
			manual pages) </SPAN>followed by a keyword will result in a
			plethora of information for most commands and key files in Linux.
			You may want to try finding out more about <B>cat</B> and <B>echo</B>
			so type <B>man cat</B> or <B>man echo</B>. This is usually the
			first port of call so when you get stuck try man first and you may
			find your answer.</P>

	<H2>What happened to my &lt;insert device here&gt;?</H2>
	<OL TYPE=a>
		<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">By now we're able to navigate the system
		and get help if needed. It's now time to find devices and how to
		use them. Unix like systems don't hide the devices away from the
		user, there are all there ready to be found right underneath our
		noses.</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The directory structure that you're
		looking at is called <A HREF="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem
		Hierarchy Standard</A>. Everything in the system can be accessed
		through the file tree. Yes, Everything! From your normal files and
		directories, to all your devices attached to the system and even
		the code the kernel is currently processing. Let me quickly
		demonstrate the power of this filesystem, <B>cat /proc/cpuinfo </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">and
		you should be presented with detailed information about the current
		status of your CPU(S). You can try some others, I'll just keep
		rambling and you can catch up to me later, Just don't <B>cat
		/proc/kcore</B>. Don't say I didn't warn you!</SPAN></FONT></P>
		<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#000000">First lets
		find your CD devices. Devices are found under the /dev directory.
		For example the physical link to your primary hard drive is
		represented by /dev/hda and the first logical partition on that
		hard drive is /dev/hda1. It's not rocket science! A standard
		convention is to link /dev/cdrom to the first cdrom drive found on
		the system and is nearly always a link to /dev/cdroms/cdrom0. Now
		that we've located the CD-ROM device we can mount it. Come on,
		focus people! Can we keep our minds out of the gutter. Mounting a
		device simply means initialise the device and prepare it for data
		transfer. </FONT>
		</P>
		<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#000000">By typing the
		command <B>mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom </B>we are asking
		the kernel to recognise the device <I>/dev/cdrom</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
		which has a filesystem of type <I>(-t iso9660)</I> iso9660 to be
		mounted in the filesystem at the point <I>/mnt/cdrom</I>. In
		english that means make the files on my cdrom readable from the
		/mnt/cdrom directory. Ensuing that you have a cdrom in the drive
		this command should execute without error. When we're finished
		reading (/writing) to a filesystem we also need to unmount it, it's
		like putting our toys away once we're finished playing with them.
		Because it's already mounted we can be lazy and get away with
		typing <B>umount /mnt/cdrom</B> and as long as it isn't in use
		(Including if you are currently in the directory) the filesystem
		will be unmounted. There are some workarounds for stubborn mounts
		and failed hardware without cutting the power but to find out more
		just <B>man mount</B>.</SPAN></FONT></P>
		<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#000000">For
		common and regularly mounted filesystems there is a file you can
		edit that will help cut down some time and also allow normal (Non
		root) users to mount the filesystem. Fire up a text editor and edit
